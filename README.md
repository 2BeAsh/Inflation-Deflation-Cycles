# Inflation-Deflation-Cycles
Code to the paper "Emergent Inflation-Deflation Cycles from Minimalistic Wage Dynamics" by Tobias H.B. Holm and Kim Sneppen. Any questions regarding the code (or paper) should be directed to T. Holm at tobiashbh@outlook.dk.

The code is structured into subfiles, but the one that should be run is `run_plotting.ipynb`, which calls different plotting functions from `plotting_master.py`.

This is a slimmed down version of the repository used throughout the project, which can be found [here]([url](https://github.com/2BeAsh/masters_project/tree/main))
